# Fabric Compatibility Module
Re-enables vanilla caves and structures in Terra to enable cross-compatibility with other mods, such as YUNG'S Better Caves or Mo' Structures.

Note that this is for Fabric only, and will not be ported to Spigot.

## Setup
- Install the mod
- In `.minecraft/config/Terra/config.yml`, under `master-disable:`, change `caves: false` to `caves: true` to disable Terra's cave generation. Otherwise your underground will look like swiss cheese.
